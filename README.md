<h1> Neural Network to recognize digits from MNIST dataset </h1>
<h2> Description </h2>
<p> The final goal, is to create a basic neural network that's able to classify handwritten digits given 
a 28x28 pixel, greyscale image. The network will be trained on the openly available MNIST database. The 
program is written in C++, and will make use of the CUDA development enviroment to perform parallel calculations.
It's nothing new, many people have done it a long time ago, but I just wanted to create a Neural Network from 
scratch, so that I could really understand how it works. </p>
